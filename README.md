## My All Time Favorite Movie
| Title      | Genre        |
| Bar Boys   | Comedy, Drama |

***My learnings from the entire movie are:***
- If you want to succeed, you must sacrifice.
- Your biggest enemy in life is yourself.
- The importance of family and friends who empathize with you during the ups and downs of your life.
- True love can wait; no matter what happens, if that person is meant for you, you'll always end up with them.
- The strictest teachers are those with the softest hearts.
